# Speech2Text Performance Tests

The application provided in this directory can be used to measure the approximate capacity of your enviornment 
for running Speech2Text. This application is made for processing RAW PCM .raw audio files, but can 
be modified quite easily to process .wav files. 

To measure the maximum throughput for a single file, we recommend that you start by running 
with a parallelWidth of 1. We also recommend that the audio you use is representative of the 
audio that you will need to be processing. For example, audio with a significant amount of silence
is processed much faster than audio without silence. Complexity of audio can also make a difference. 

If you have a real-time requirement for your application (for example, in a call-center), then we 
recommend looking at the real-time factor measurement for each file. You can find this in the 
<test-name>_Performance.txt file. We recommend that for parallel tests, the audio being processed 
is split into files that are small in relation to the length of time needed to complete the test. 
The reason being that at the end of a test, you could end up with a single engine finishing a large 
file for several minutes while the other engines in parallel run idle because the rest of files have been
processed already. 

Once the test is complete, the  <test-name>_Performance.txt will also have the total time it took to process
the audio provided. This can be used to approximate the time it will take for batch processing of audio. 

## Minimum to run with defaults (must supply Watson model and config): 
	st submitjob output/com.ibm.streamsx.speech2text.perf.PerfTest.sab -P watsonModelFile=/homes/hny5/cooka/git/toolkit.speech2text/model/EnUS_Telephony_r2.2.3.pkg -P watsonConfigFile=/homes/hny5/cooka/git/toolkit.speech2text/model/EnUS_Telephony_r2.2.3-8kHz-diarization-error.pset

## Full Submission
	st submitjob output/com.ibm.streamsx.speech2text.perf.PerfTest.sab -P watsonModelFile=/homes/hny5/cooka/git/toolkit.speech2text/model/EnUS_Telephony_r2.2.3.pkg -P watsonConfigFile=/homes/hny5/cooka/git/toolkit.speech2text/model/EnUS_Telephony_r2.2.3-8kHz-diarization-error.pset -P audioDirectory=../../audio_even -P numFiles=31 -P numRepetitions=1 -P blockSize=200 -P writeUtterancesToFile=false -P testName=testParams

## Parameter Description

	<name> : <default-value> - <Description>
	watsonModelFile : <none> - Required: The location of the Watson .pkg file to run with this test. 
	watsonConfigFile : <none> - Required: The location of the Watson .pset config file to run this test. 
	testName : <default> - The name of the test. This will be used to write out performance results to <test-name>_Performance.txt and utterances to <test-name>_Utterances.txt. 
	writeUtterancesToFile : <true> - Boolean value of whether or not to write utterances to file. For extremely large parallel tests, we recommend you use false.  
	parallelWidth : <10> - Number of Speech2Text engines to have running in parallel. 
	blockSize : <200> - Number of bytes per tuple being sent to the WatsonS2T engine. For RTP packets, ~200 bytes. 
	numRepetitions : <1> - Number of times to submit the files from a directory for processing. This allows you to create large tests from a small number of audio files. 
	numFiles : <5> - Number of .raw files to be processed from the provided directory. 
	audioDirectory : <audio> - Location of the audio to be processed. 

## Results Analysis
There will be two output files for each test: 
	* <test-name>_Performance.txt - This will contain the processing time for each file, as well as the real-time factor for processing that file. 
	At the bottom, there will also be a "Test Completed" message that gives the total time to complete the test. 
	* <test-name>_utterances.txt - If the test is set to actually write utterances, you will find them here. 
	
**Real-time Factor** - Calculated as (Processing Time) / (Time of Audio). This is a key measurement. If you can process audio representative 
of what you want to process in production, then finding the number of parallel engines where you maintain a Real-time factor < 1, allows you 
to estimate the number of S2T engines you can run in parallel in production.
