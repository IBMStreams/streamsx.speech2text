To test the capturing of packets from  a network tap follow the below
instructions. 

===================================

1. Make sure that version 2.8.3+ of the com.ibm.streamsx.network toolkit is available in your $STREAMS_SPLPATH com.ibm.streamsx.network 3.1.0+ with RTP operators, 
available currently https://github.com/Alex-Cook4/streamsx.network/tree/rtp-dev toolkits
	- `$ export STREAMS_SPLPATH=/path/to/network/toolkit:$STREAMS_SPLPATH`
2. Run make
	- `$ make`

===================================== 
# Running in Standalone

The executable created above will need the proper permissions to be able to
read from a network tap ... 

To set the permissions on the executable you need sudo authority  

First unbundle the .sab file created 

`$ spl-app-info output/com.ibm.streamsx.speech2text.callcenter.networktap.Main.sab --unbundle unbundled`

Then set the permission using sudo or run as root  

`$ /usr/sbin/setcap 'CAP_NET_RAW+eip CAP_NET_ADMIN+eip' unbundled/output/bin/standalone`
 
=====================================

To run the program issue 

Where networkInterace :  eth2 is replaced  with the interface to be monitored. 
 
 `$ ./unbundled/output/bin/standalone  networkInterface=eth2  connHost=hostname connPort=23146`

# Running in Distributed

1. You must have your domain controller registered as a system service. You can do this using the following command (you will need root authority): 
	- `$ sudo -E $STREAMS_INSTALL/bin/streamtool registerdomainhost --zkconnect <zk-connect-string>`
2. Set the following properties: 
	```streamtool setproperty instance.runAsUser=$USER
	streamtool setproperty instance.canSetPeOSCapabilities=true
	streamtool setproperty instance.applicationBundlesPath=<some location in /tmp, must be local to the machine (no nfs)> 
	```
	You will have to restart the instance after running these commands: streamtool stopinstance; streamtool startinstance;
3. Submit the job: 
	- `streamtool submitjob -P networkInterface=eth1 -P connPort=23146 --jobname NetworkTap output/com.ibm.streamsx.speech2text.callcenter.networktap.Main.sab`
